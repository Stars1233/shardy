### `-sdy-close-shardings`

_Closes tensor shardings and drops replicated axes._

### `-sdy-constant-or-scalar-merger`

_Merge identical constants and scalar expansions with matching shardings._

Performs a lightweight CSE on constants with identical shardings.

The import pipeline splits and duplicates the constants and scalar
expansions such that sharding is not propagated between different uses of a
constant sub-computation. If the constants have same shardings after
propagation, this pass merges them to save compilation time. See
-sdy-constant-or-scalar-splitter for more info.

### `-sdy-drop-sharding-rules`

_Drops `OpShardingRuleAttr` from all registered ops._

### `-sdy-insert-explicit-reshards`

_Inserts explicit reshards to make all operations have compatible shardings._

A compatible sharding essentially means that the operation can accept the
sharded operands and produce a sharded result without requiring any reshard
communications (note that the operation might still require communication
such as all-reduce or halo-swaps).

After propagation, some operations may still have incompatible shardings.

Note that when an axis (or sub-axis) is used to shard non-corresponding
dimensions (e.g. non-contracting dimensions in matmul) across multiple
tensors, or when an axis shards a dimension in one tensor but not the
corresponding dimension in the other tensor, it is said that the operation
has a sharding conflict. Hence, after this pass, the operations become
conflict-free.

This pass injects reshard operations explicitly so that, for each operation,
corresponding dimensions become sharded in the same way across all operands
and results, and every axis (or sub-axis) can only be used to shard a single
dimension type.

Example:

Input:
```mlir
mesh = <"x"=4, "y"=2>
%lhs : tensor<8x32xf32> {sdy.sharding=<@mesh, \[{"x"}, {"y"}\]>}
%rhs : tensor<32x16xf32> {sdy.sharding=<@mesh, \[{"y"}, {"x"}\]>}
stablehlo.dot %lhs, %rhs {sdy.sharding_per_value=<[<@mesh, \[{"x"}, {}\]>]>}
  : (tensor<8x32xf32>, tensor<32x16xf32>) -> tensor<8x16xf32>
```

Output:
```mlir
sdy.mesh = <"x"=4, "y"=2>
%lhs : tensor<8x32xf32> {sdy.sharding=<@mesh, \[{"x"}, {"y"}\]>}
%rhs : tensor<32x16xf32> {sdy.sharding=<@mesh, \[{"y"}, {"x"}\]>}
%0 = sdy.reshard %rhs <@mesh, \[{"y"}, {}\]> : tensor<32x16xf32>
stablehlo.dot %lhs, %0 {sdy.sharding_per_value=<[<@mesh, \[{"x"}, {}\]>]>}
  : (tensor<8x32xf32>, tensor<32x16xf32>) -> tensor<8x16xf32>
```

In the example above, `lhs` and `rhs` are both sharded on axis "x" on their
non-contracting dimensions, which is incompatible. The pass inserts an
explicit reshard on `rhs` before the dot operation, so that the dot
operation has compatible shardings.

#### Options

```
-enable-full-version                  : Enable full version.
-avoid-reshards-on-named-computations : Avoid explicit reshards/collectives on named computations.
```

### `-sdy-remove-all-gather-reduce-scatter-for-cmv1`

_Removes sdy.all_gather and sdy.reduce_scatter for CMV1._

Removes all-gather in the pattern all-gather + dot. Removes reduce-scatter
in the pattern dot + reduce-scatter. This pass is for compatibility with
collective matmul V1 (CMV1). It is a temporary solution for b/432019089.

### `-sdy-remove-propagation-debug-info`

_Removes propagation debug info (propagation edges and origin shardings) during export._

### `-sdy-remove-sharding-groups`

_Removes ShardingGroupOps after propagation._

### `-sdy-reshard-to-collectives`

_Converts ReshardOp into various Shardy collective ops._

Matches reshard ops and rewrites them into various Shardy collective
ops. After this pass, no reshard ops remain in the module.

Optionally if `keepRedundantReshards` is true, the only reshard ops that
remain are the redundant ones. By default it assumes that explicit reshards
have already been inserted (`sdy-insert-explicit-reshards`) and does not
keep redundant reshards. It should keep redundant reshards if explicit
reshards may have not been already inserted.

Example:

Input:
```mlir
mesh = <"x"=2, "y"=2, "z"=2>
%0 : tensor<16x2xf32> {sdy.sharding<@mesh, \[{"x", "y", "z"}, {}\]>
%1 = sdy.reshard %arg0 <@mesh, \[{"x"}, {}\]> : tensor<16x2xf32>
```

Output:
```mlir
mesh = <"x"=2, "y"=2, "z"=2>
%0 : tensor<16x2xf32> {sdy.sharding<@mesh, \[{"x", "y", "z"}, {}\]>
%1 = sdy.all_gather  \[{"y", "z"}, {}\] %arg0 out_sharding=<@mesh, \[{"x"}, {}\]> : tensor<16x2xf32>
```

In the example above, the tensor `%0 : tensor<16x2xf32>` is sharded as
`\[{"x", "y", "z"}, {}\]`. Then, there's a `reshard` op resharding it as
`\[{"x"}, {}\]`. On the first axes, since the suffix `{"y", "z"}` is removed
after the reshard, we infer that we have all-gathered `{"y", "z"}`. The
second dimension is not changed.


#### Options

```
-keep-redundant-reshards : Whether it keeps redundant reshards or removes.
```

### `-sdy-sharding-constraint-to-reshard`

_Converts ShardingConstraintOp into ReshardOp._

### `-sdy-sink-data-flow-edges`

_Sinks all `DataFlowEdgeOp` into their input._

Moves the sharding of each `DataFlowEdgeOp` to its input (the root target of
the edge), and replaces the op with its input.

#### Options

```
-sink-debug-sharding-origins          : Whether to sink the debug sharding origins info. See `debug-sharding-origins` option in propagation for more info.
-sink-debug-propagation-edge-sharding : Whether to sink the debug propagation edge sharding info. See `debug-propagation-edge-sharding` option in propagation for more info.
```

### `-sdy-update-non-divisible-input-output-shardings`

_Makes FuncOp inputs/outputs evenly sharded, removing any need for padding due to non-divisible shardings._

Users of Shardy expect the function inputs/outputs to be evenly
divisible/shardable to avoid requiring padding their tensors. Propagation
may make inputs/outputs have non-divisible shardings, so this pass updates
them to the largest dimension sharding prefix of the original sharding that
is evenly sharded.
